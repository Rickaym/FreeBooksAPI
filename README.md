A comprehensive (unofficial) API service for [planet-ebooks](https://www.planetebook.com/), [gen.lib.rus.ec/libgen.rs](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/), [libgen.lc/libgen.li](http://libgen.lc/), providing API endpoints to retrieve download URLs, mirrors, publication metadata, and the likes.

## Features

- Searching books by name, author name, topic and etc...
- Retrieve free download URLs for books and publications
- Retrieve torrent datadumps for free books

## Getting Started

We'll need to keep in mind the following base URLs to understand the whole API.

| Base Url      | https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/ |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Versioned base url      | https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/v{major} (or) /latest/ |
| Library selector | https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/v{major}/{library} |

For specific API Reference, look at [Swagger Docs](https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/latest/docs) or [ReDoc](https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/latest/redoc) (same documentation, different UIs).


### Searching Example

There are a few libraries we can pick from when querying for publications. We'll use [libgen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) in this example with the url args <sup>*(more about the existing url args in the docs)*</sup> "dostoyevsky" as our query string and a limit of 1 publication record.

Using the versioned base url with the library selected, we get the following curl command:
```s
curl -X GET \
  'https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/latest/libgen/search?q=dostoyevsky&limit=1'
```

a Python equivalent example using requests would simply be:

```py
import requests

url = "https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/latest/libgen/search?q=dostoyevsky&limit=1"

response = requests.request("GET", url)
```

#### Different Libraries

Switching libraries is simply done through substituting the `{library}` url arg from our base url with an available library ID.

The exact same GET request for the above example using planetebooks would be:

```s
curl -X GET \
  'https://freebooksapi.pyaesonemyo.me/latest/planetebooks/search?q=dostoyevsky&limit=1'
```
